Modifying the encipherment transforms the Vigen√®re cipher into a one-time pad (OTP) encryption scheme, which is semantically secure. This is because it has resistance against cryptanalysis, since the key is not repeated, and an attacker cannot gain any information about the plaintext without knowing the key. To ensure that this one-time pad is secure, the key must be generated randomly. Pseudo-random generators are not as secure because they can introduce patterns that could potentially be exploited by an attacker. Other than the original requirement that the key length must be as long as the plaintext, each key should only be used once, and the key must be securely given to the sender and the receiver.
